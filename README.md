I'm a Master's student in Robotics (Electrical and Computer Engineering) at Northeastern University, Boston with a background in Instrumentation and Control Engineering. I'm passionate about the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and spatial computing. I'm currently working as a Part-time Lab Associate at the XR Immersive Media Lab, where I develop and test XR applications using Unity on XR devices, enhancing students' practical skills. I have over two years of professional experience at Tata Elxsi Limited in Bangalore, developing cutting-edge visual computing solutions.

**Currently Exploring:** Advancements in robotics, real-time computer vision applications, and spatial computing technologies.

**Skills:** Python / C++ / OpenCV / PyTorch / TensorFlow / ROS / GTSAM / CVXPY / Raspberry Pi / C# / JavaScript / Unity3D / Blender

- üî≠ I'm currently working on applying computer vision techniques using OpenCV for real-time applications.
- üå± I'm currently learning more about SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for robot navigation.
- üëØ I'm looking to collaborate on projects related to image/video processing, robotics, and spatial computing.
- ü§î I'm looking for help with advanced object-tracking algorithms and optimizing them for embedded systems.
- üíº **Part-time Lab Associate:** XR Immersive Media Lab, Northeastern University. Developing XR educational tools and managing lab operations for devices like Meta Quest Pro and HoloLens 2.
